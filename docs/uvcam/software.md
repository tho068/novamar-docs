## Starting the program

Start the program by clicking the "SeaBed camera" shortcut located at the desktop, or search for the program in the start menu.

The status line at the bottom of the program gives information about the state of the pressure sensor, lights and the GPS. Click connect if they are still disconnected after two minutes has passed.
