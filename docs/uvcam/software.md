## Starting the program

Start the program by clicking the "SeaBed camera" shortcut located at the desktop, or search for the program in the start menu. 

When the program is started, it tries to connect to the camera, pressure sensor, lights and the attached GPS. This may take some time, especially the camera is a bit slow to start. Please wait for about two minutes, and click the connect button if the video feed is not displaying correctly.

The status line at the bottom of the program gives information about the state of the pressure sensor, lights and the GPS. Click connect if they are still disconnected after two minutes has passed.

Information about depth, pressure, gps coordinates and the current time is overlaid onto the captured files.
