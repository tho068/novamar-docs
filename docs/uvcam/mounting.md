2. Attach the three red hinges at both side of the frame using a 10 mm wrench. The red hinge should be on the inside of the frame to avoid objects getting stuck during surveys.

4. Connect the two subconn cables going from the power supply to the connectors located on the top of the housing.

5. Connect the two subconn cables going from the lights to the connectors on the underside of the housing.

6. Connect the camera rig to the pelicase and power the pelicase with 220 VAC.

7. Connect the USB and Ethernet cable inside the pelicase to the rugged computer.

8. Make sure that all subconn cables are connected, and turn on the circuit breaker in the pelicase.

## Disassembly

This section describes the disassembly procedures. 

1. Turn off the circuit breaker in the pelicase and disconnect the power cable to the rig.

::: danger Disconnect power
Remove all power from the system before continuing with the procedure to avoid any damage.

2. Disconnect the two cables going from the power supply to the top of the camera housing. The next step is to detach the power supply from the camera housing. Start by unscrewing the two nuts holding the power supply rods in place. After the nuts are removed, gently remove the power supply. Some pressure might be needed to get the rods through the holes.

3. The second step is to unscrew the four red hinges at each side of the rig. To loosen the hinges, hold the handle in place and twist counter clockwise with a 10 mm wrench on the nuts. The handles should loose easily.

4. Disconnect the cables to both lights and wrap the connectors in a plastic bag to keep them protected. 

5. Remove the top from the bottom frame. Pay attention to the warning below.

::: danger Careful with the glass dome
The glass dome is very fragile. Be careful when handling the top to avoid any damage to the glass.

## Maintenance

::: tip Avoid water entering connectors
Remember to lubricate the connectors with silicon at regular intervals to avoid sea water corroding the connector pins.
:::

::: tip Clean the glass dome
Clean the glass dome with specialized lense cleaner to keep the lense clean without scratching the glass.
