# Introduction

[Datalog](https://datalog.no) is a cloud platform for data collection, processing and visualization of data from IoT sensors. The platform is network agnostic and supports industry standard protocols such as MQTT. 

The Datalog frontend (aka website) is divided into three primary sections

- Dashboard
- Things
- Settings

## Dashboard

The dashboard section is used to visualize data from connected devices. In this section, users create personalized dashboards using our widgets. Currently we support four different widgets: timeseries, gauges, LED (used to display booleans) and values. The illustration below shows the value, LED and timeseries widgets.
